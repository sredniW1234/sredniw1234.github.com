                    <h1 class="text-center card-body display-6">Homeostasis is extremely important to everything that goes on in your body. It also ties in closely with
                        body systems. Without either of them, we wouldn't function properly.</h1>

                    <h1 class="text-center card-body display-6">It benefits to learn how homeostasis and body systems
                        are and what they do. Even if you aren't going into the medical industry, you could still use
                        this knowledge to help understand why you might be sick or what's happening to your body. Not to
                        mention that more knowledge can't hurt.</h1>

                    <h1 class="text-center card-body display-6">You can find homeostasis and body systems working everywhere.
                        Take any part of the body, and you'll, with almost 100% certainty, find these systems working to keep
                        you alive and working properly.</h1>
