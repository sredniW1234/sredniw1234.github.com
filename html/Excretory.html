        <h1 class="display-6">The excretory system is the body system that handles the disposal of bodily wastes. These
            wastes range from excess water and urine, to nitrogenous wastes in the blood and carbon dioxide.</h1>

                <h1 class="display-6">The kidneys is an organ in the body that filters wastes from the blood. As the blood
                passes through the kidneys, they remove a waste known as urea from the blood. This is then formed into urine.</h1>

                <h1 class="display-6">The ureters are narrow tubes that carry the urine created from the kidneys to the
                    bladder. They do this via a process called peristalsis which is the process of contracting and relaxing
                muscles to move the contents of, in this case the ureters, forward.</h1>

        <h1 class="display-6">The kidneys remove the nitrogenous waste via small filters called nephrons. According to

                University of Rochester Medical Center</a>, there are approximately one million
        of these nephrons in each kidney, equating to 2 million total. These quickly sort out the urea from the blood and
            makes urine. The ureters the take the urine to the bladder to be held. Finally, when the time comes, the
        urethra releases the urine, removing the waste from the body.</h1>
