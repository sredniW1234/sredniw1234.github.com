    <h1 class="display-6 m-3"><span class="fs-3">* This is somewhat of a TLDR *</span> The Respiratory System is a
        system in which we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide in the process called respiration.</h1>

        <hr>
        <h1 class="display-6">The respiratory system is a body system that involves breathing. To put it more precisely,
        breathing is the process of inhaling oxygen and exhaling a waste product called carbon dioxide.</h1>
    </div>

        <h1 class="display-3 lh-1" id="what-are-the-parts?">2.&nbsp&nbspWhat are the parts?</h1>
        <hr>
        <h1 class="display-6">The main parts of the respiratory system is the mouth/nose, throat, larynx, trachea,
        bronchi, and the lungs.</h1>

                <hr>
                <h1 class="display-6">The mouth and nose is where air is taken in from and where carbon dioxide is expelled.
                    Although we can breathe in and out from both, they serve different purposes. The mouth is mainly for eating
                and speaking whereas the nose is for breathing, filtering debris, and smelling.</h1>

                <hr>
                <h1 class="display-4">The throat is a hollow tube located in the neck. It serves the main function of transporting
                liquid, foods, and oxygen. </h1>

                <hr>
                <h1 class="display-6">The larynx, more commonly know as the voice box, helps produce sounds. These sounds
                can change in pitch and loudness. Using said sounds, people can form different formations of their mouth and
                tongue to form words and speak.</h1>

                <hr>
                <h1 class="display-6">The trachea, commonly know to many as the windpipe, is another hollow tube, similar
                    to that of the throat. It carries the inhaled oxygen from the throat into the lungs and the carbon dioxide from
                the lungs to the throat to be exhaled.</h1>

                <h1 class="display-6">There are actually two lungs within you, although they do preform the same function.
                The lungs is the location in which gas exchange between oxygen and carbon dioxide happens. But before
                then, the oxygen must go through tiny tubes called bronchi and bronchioles.</h1>

                <hr>
                <h1 class="display-6">The bronchi are little tubes that carry oxygen into tinier tubes called bronchioles.
                These bronchioles then lead to minuscule, grape-like sacs called alveoli. Alveoli hold the oxygen in order
                for said oxygen to swap with the carbon dioxide that is to be exhaled.</h1>
