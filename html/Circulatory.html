                        pumping the blood to and from the body. The heart has multiple valves in order to let blood pass
                    through in one direction but not another.</h1>

                    <h1 class="display-6">The blood is the actual liquid that is transported through the body. It contains
                    two different type of cells, red and white blood cells. Red blood cells are the cells that carry the
                    resources such as oxygen and nutrients. White blood cells help fight off bacteria and infections that
                    are unwanted or harmful.</h1>

                    That's why it is a critical emergency when you puncture, block, or clog an artery because it is the vessel that
                    transports the oxygen to your cells.</h1>

                    <h1 class="display-6">Veins are the other type of blood vessel. Their main function is to return the blood
                    from your organs back to the heart. The blood that they carry aren't oxygenated but instead deoxygenated.
                    This in simple terms means that it lacks oxygen and instead carries carbon dioxide.</h1>

            From here, the now oxygen rich blood then goes back to the heart and through the various valves. The blood then
            gets distributed throughout the body, through the various arteries, capillaries, and veins. The blood then
            flows back to the heart to restart the cycle.</h1>
