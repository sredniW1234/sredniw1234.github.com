                                            The reason why you sweat is due to the fact you're too hot so your body tries to cool you down
                                            by sweating. Similarly, when you shiver, it's your body trying to warm you up
                                            because it's too cold.

                                            If you have too much glucose in your bloodstream, hormones sent by the pancreas
                                            called insulin cause it to go down. Another hormone called glucagon raises it
                                            when it's too low. Diseases such as diabetes interrupt homeostasis directly by
                                            making the pancreas no produce enough insulin causing blood sugar levels to not
                                            be balanced.
