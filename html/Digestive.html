                    our teeth chew the food into a little ball called a bolus. Our different kinds of teeth, tongue, and
                    saliva help in this process. The saliva helps the </h1>

                <h1 class="display-6">The esophagus is a part of a canal that transports food. Its main purpose is to
                    connect the mouth and the stomach. It also can be referred to as the gullet. It is usually lined with
                mucous in order to help lubricate the bolus so that it can be passed down easier.</h1>

                <h1 class="display-6">The stomach is the second place where mechanical digestion happens. The stomach churns
                and mixes pepsin, an enzyme produced by the stomach, to continue to digest the food. In the stomach, the
                main function of pepsin is to break down proteins into smaller components such as peptides and amino acids.</h1>

                    large intestine. In the small intestine, chemical digestion occurs. This means that the intestine
                absorbs the nutrients and minerals while also getting rid of anything that is not needed.</h1>

                <h1 class="display-6">The large intestine's main function is to absorb any water that might be left in
                    the food. It also absorbs vitamins and forming feces. It is the tube between the small intestine and
                the anus. Once the food gets to the end of the large intestine, the large intestine pushes the feces to the anus.</h1>

            mechanical digestion, when the food is smaller we begin to swallow the remains into our body. This starts
