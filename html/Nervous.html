        <hr>
        <h1 class="display-6" > The nervous system is responsible for any sensation, movement, and instinct you have
            inside your body. The nervous system also allows every body part to move, including sight, smell, breath,
            think, and more. </h1>

        <h1 class="display-6"> The main components of the nervous system are the brain, spinal cord, motor neurons,
            sensory neurons, and the nerves.</h1>

                <h1 class="display-6">The brain is what controls the entire body, from movement, to thinking, to breathing.
                The brain is extremely complex, so much so that we don't know a lot about how the brain works. The brain
                controls, along with the spinal cord, makes up the central nervous system.</h1>

                <hr>
                <h1 class="display-6">The spinal cord is a cord that connects your brain all the way down to your lower back.
                It carries important neural signals to and from the brain. That's why it's critical whenever you injure
                your spine as it can cause paralysis due to the cut of neural signals.</h1>

                <hr>
                <h1 class="display-6">Motor neurons are neurons that control your muscles, organs, and glands in your body.
                These carry specific signals from the brain and spinal cord to actuate your muscles. These movements can
                either be voluntary or involuntary.</h1>

                <hr>
                <h1 class="display-6">Sensory neurons detect changes in the environment, either chemically or physically.
                    When this happens, the neurons send a signal to the spinal cord to relay to the brain for processing.</h1>

            spinal cord uses the motor neurons to send the information to the muscles. </h1>

        <h1 class="display-6"> The brain makes the responses, movement, emotions, speaking, and everything else that
            makes a human and sends that information to the spinal cord. The spinal cord uses the motor neurons to
            transportation the information from the brain to the body and back. The spinal cord uses the motor neurons
            to send the information to the muscles to make the muscles move and act in a way we move. The sensory neuron
            carries information about changes in the environment.</h1>

    <h1 class="display-6"> The ending of the nervous system, ends when the changes in the environment signals are sent
        back to the brain. Resulting to any movements done.</h1>
